hi, i’m iflex
Content Creator (Used to be, don't have the time for it now) | Creative Project Leader | Student
combining technology and creativity, with interest in looking forward to cybersecurity.

## about me

* creative at heart, leading up and launching visual personal brand stuff, working out how things look, and helping to run some pretty busy communities.
* heading towards cybersecurity & learning basics now and wanting to literally dive head-first into cyber defense.
* I write, translate, and adapt.

**motto:**

> “make it meaningful or don’t make it at all.”

## General Things I Care About:

* **cybersecurity** (will return to it later)
* **graphical design** (e.g., for thumbnails, branding, visuals in general)
  *creative writing, translation & adaptation*
* **community stuff** (setting up super secured discord servers, maintaining them, making them automated and better)

## random facts & things that inspire me:

* i love the world of *[A Plague Tale](https://aplaguetale.qzz.io/)*, its storyline and
* like projects that integrate technology, art, and human beings.
* always finding new ways of storytelling and just learning to better know people.
* my handle iFlex is NOT from apples (i actually despise them), it's actually a combination of 2 nethandles i used, half of it actually being "iFlex"
* i look depressed, but im not, thats the default face and method of communication for me, no hard feelings.
* it is hard to get to know me more intimately than just another anonymous virtual transient friend, trust issues ate me inside ou ;d
