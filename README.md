## random facts & things that inspire me:

* i’m really into *[A Plague Tale](https://aplaguetale.qzz.io/)* its world, story and how it looks.
* love projects that bring together tech, art, and people.
* always looking for new ways to tell stories and just get to know folks more.
* my name iFlex is not an inspiration from apple devices (i actually hate them), its instead a combo of 2 online names i used, half of which is basically "iFlex"
* i look depressed, but im not, thats the default expression and way of communicating for me, no hard feelings.
* its hard to get to know me more than just an online temporary friend, trust issues ate awayq0
